watched a world grow  
for like a month straight  
passed by for work  
bout two times a day  
  
was  
cleared space, abandoned lot  
is  
home, village, gathering spot  
  
maybe we can help  
drop something off  
you know we together  
all ain’t got a lot  
  
is  
sunny day, drove by  
was  
flack jackets, colonize  
  
“you can’t live your life  
cause I can’t live mine”  
boy I tell you what  
said livin’ ain’t a crime  
  
was   
propaganda, patronize  
is  
just people, livin life  
  
so them people sigh  
keep rollin they eyes  
while He says proudly  
yes! this is mine.
