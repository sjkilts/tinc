see it’s a narssicisitic nation  
the you essay  
rape culture as a strategy  
let’s make it go away  
  
do u under stand  
  
to put a disclaimer about appropriate use  of content or an age warning  
what is accesibility  
  
murder happening  
grass and lots of little things  
death is gasoline  
   
all a weird performance scene  
  
look around and see!  
straight lines cut in living things  
out of place to we
