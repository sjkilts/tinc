heard “ain’t nothin sacred  
if in’t workin out fo me  
times changed, yall can’t be  
heard this land was taken just for me”  
  
well fuck all that  
and blessed is what we be  
fo’ where we from done land we  
where we be  
  
don’t you see   
little me  
sittin high as the trees   
lookin down at the grass beneath my feet?  
  
everything you touch  
said everything you breath  
is holy and sacred and free  
  
they called me old man  
back when i was just three  
ancestors, who i see  
  
everything you want  
said everything you need  
is holy and sacred and free  
  
you can laugh or you can listen  
i’ll just be doing me  
never alone big brother everything  
  
every bit of dust  
said every little thing   
is holy and sacred and free
