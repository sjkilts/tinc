      - irl we really want the ion drive to work in atmosphere, and we need battery stuff to change dramatically  
      - the sound-based battery system could work very well if we can get it out of the ocean / scale  
      - am not a physicist so actually working on that myself is not really ideal?  
      - will, if necessary. go to school?  would be better to have money to throw at physicists  
      - something like the SMART grant would help  
      - two ideas  
      - 1 not that useful maybe but e-ink license plate. only legal in three states, but new. should be an easy sell  
      - 2 floating load delivery platform proof of concept  
      - - basically just a flat drone to push boxes around on  
      - - could be self-guided eventually, main goal is have it respond to touch input  
      - - so push on a side, it goes that direction  
      - - compensates automatically to not tip when you push, etc.  
      - - trying to build a scale model proof of concept, to move a scale load in the way a forklift typically does  
      - - this inital product would then be roughly a forklift the size of a pallet, hopefully charged long enough to unload a truck  
      - - remote user input to raise a load up into storage safely as an individual  
      - - powered battery base that responds to the same usable touch input so the platform can charge in use unless flying  
      - * e-ink license plate could probably be kickstarted with a render  
      - - - this is a great side project that could mean big money  
      - - - see if people are excited.  if an industrial designer chose to invest a little time this could happen quick  
      - * side scroller game could be a fun way to build interest and make some side money  
      - - start with jank battery powered drone hoverboard  
      - - work up to ion drive, infinite power  
      - - add in other cool things like the flying car, bike, home etc.  
      - - like alto meets hill climb  
      - - minimal ads, like alto  
      - - store with merch etc  
      - - early release a hoverboard through the game one day ;)  
      - * something something floating carbon fiber cadillac luxury camper home  
      - - like, its a whole new world baby  
      - have enough knowledge to build some version of the drone thing, have an industrial designer to help with packaging  
      - could probably get both of those ideas done without too much third party input?  
      - we need third party input for the cool stuff.    
      - if we can fund a feasibility report from MIT guys about the ion drive and sound based battery  
      - that would be cool and tell us enough to either get big funding or sit on the idea  
      -  
      - blah blah future this could be a floating platform that cleans the air and is powered by sound what do you want  
      - yes, flying surfboard  
      - yes, flying car  
      - your jetsons house is still kinda dumb  
      - yes, floating moss hut

      data suggests (mt blanc) that permits may actually hurt overall rescue numbers  
      not gatekeeping access greatly increases the likelyhood of climbers helping each other  
      this is common, and not accurately reported or reflected in any data  
      adding any cost cap or registration hoop to jump through will restrict people  
      are multi-day big-wall climbers an actual problem?  
      compared to other user groups, my biased personal experience suggests the opposite  
        
      yosar was climbers self regulating alongside NPS  
        
      NPS is forest cops  
        
      scenarios permitting makes some sense:  
      high risk/alpine  
      incliment weather/alipine  
      not truly applicable to el cap   
      perhaps in extreme scenarios which weren't planned for  
      which is the point of a rescue system  
      otherwise undue buracracy increasing regulation on public land  
        
      NPS is using skewed data   
      and international catastrophe                   
      to push a police state agenda  
        
      this seems like an attempt to control and gather data  
      specifically isolates a specific user group   
      adds additional cost and complication which primarily impacts low income and minority users  
      who knows what regulations climbers or others who are respectfully exploring the outdoors could eventually face  
        
      next up: wear a satellite beacon registered with NPS, nasa and SPACEX  
      must be worn at all times on public land or face fines and or imprisonment  
      it's only $1700 for the tracker and the required service is $129.99 a month forever!  
        
      based on nothing but intuition it seems likely that influential people in  
      NPS, YOSAR and popular Yosemite climbing access groups are seeing benifits from this beyond the impact to everyday climbers  
        
      at best it's a lazy way to get other people do do their work for them,  
      while charging us for the privlidge   
        
      more negative use cases involve data collection  
      used for marketing, advertising, funding  
      even potentially selling future permits for gatekeeping amounts of money  
      (a permit costs 15,000 euro to climb popular routes on Mont Blanc in 2022,   
      this is not resolving their rescue problem caused by undereducated, overconfident people)  
        
      a likely outcome for this permit system is increasing popularity of big in-a-day climbs  
      this style of climbing is incredibly risky, even when undertaken by pro-level climbers  
      a large increase in popularity of speed climbing has potentially huge negative implications  
      huge future potential for speed climbing to become popular with under or mis-educated masses   
      this could cause a much larger strain on rescue resources than big wall climbing ever has

      paper list of product ideas has been made, probably ideal to track here

      css and markdown footnotes function   
      create immersive overlay displaying footnotes on touch or hover
