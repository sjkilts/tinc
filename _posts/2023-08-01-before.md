before plantations
this was plant nation
afore i was born
feel like all my plans taken
every block stankin
smelly like bacon
pig sticker baby
how much more is we taken? 

stolen from our home
now it’s asphalt and pavement 
been taken as a child 
know moms just tryna make it
expectation failure 
been sold out by her nation
call it muddy waters 
but that sound racist 

eyy motherfucker
lets get back to basics
you
want my sovereignty?
come take it.

where my house stands man
ah there use to be a tree
stood fiddy feet wide 
five hunred feet deep
now all night long
you can feel the earth scream
but someone somewhere 
got a pick fo’ they teeth

oh I tell you what girl
said right where we be
been ninety nine years
since our eyes could see
cap’n told us then
boy clear them trees 
those branches there is tryn’a 
hide the sky from me

now I can’t figure why
but I can’t really breathe
and every where I look 
it just seems to be
a little more grey
a little less green
one more river don’t track
where it use to be

on the way to nanas house
the woods is gone
that hill been flattened
and the road cut’s long
been drivin for a while
still I don’t know shit
limit say sixty-five 
ya’ll goin ninety-six

eyy see your construct
yes we see you racist
you
want my sovereignty?
come take it.

see a man got money
but he don’t really work
see a man back breakin
just pushin round the earth
can’t stop if he wanted
don matter if it hurt
wi this family displacement
all he get to do is dirt

well I’ll say I’m earth
while you say I’m green
I say give it back
like how it use to be
yall red and blue
land over some scheme
we just tryin’a live here
like we use to be

till you get off the fence
the land can’t be
release your cutting lines 
like it use to be
stop righ now
let the land be free
looking forward, living
like we use to be

we’re taking our dirt back
our dust
our holy things
they say if you love it
let it free
let it be
well let us roam free
like we use to be




whitey
i said
whitey
you colonizer
you bastard
whitey
fuck your fence whitey
jesus knew that he was dark
and belonged to the land, amen
