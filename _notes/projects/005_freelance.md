cover letter - frontend engineer  
  
Hello,  
  
  
My name is Scott Kilts.  A detail-oriented frontend engineer working in Jekyll, Markdown, JavaScript and Sass.  Excited about writing clean, minimal code.  I would be happy to implement your new pages.   
  
Here is a Jekyll site I worked on recently: https://tenantsrights.github.io/tacoma/    
  
Thanks for your time.  I look forward to hearing from you,
