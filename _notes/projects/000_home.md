current: 
  - the dyneema cord you have is plenty strong enough  
    
priority:
  - get psyched  
          

current:
  - attempting to streamline notes.yml / notes.md  
  - currently renders pretty well  
  - at the point where input is the issue  
  - need something cleaner for daily use  
  - here we are    
    
goal:
  - use prose as a clean way to input and manage notes
  - display easy to reference notes on webpage   
    
info:
  - have metadata set up in config that mirrors notes.yml
  - using prose to manage notes/projects
  - should be able to have one page per project
  - grab metadata in the same way as notes.yml
  - consolidate notes for the project  
    
next:
  - proof of concept pulling note and project data / todos
  - if successful
  - import remaining projects, notes  
    
missing anything?  
    
bonus:
  - shoould be able to pull all the todos from every project 
  - sort / display them together
  - free the world
  - etc.
