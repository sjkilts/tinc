data suggests (mt blanc) that permits may actually hurt overall rescue numbers    
not gatekeeping access greatly increases the likelyhood of climbers helping each other  
this is common, and not accurately reported or reflected in any data  
adding any cost cap or registration hoop to jump through will restrict people  
are multi-day big-wall climbers an actual problem?  
compared to other user groups, my biased personal experience suggests the opposite  
  
[yosar was climbers self regulating alongside NPS](https://setthelandfree.github.io/freewalls/wall-permit/yosar.html)  
  
[NPS is forest cops](https://setthelandfree.github.io/freewalls/wall-permit/nps-is-forest-cops.html)  
  
[scenarios permitting makes some sense:](https://setthelandfree.github.io/freewalls/wall-permit/where-permitting-makes-sense.html)  
high risk/alpine  
incliment weather/alipine  
not truly applicable to el cap   
perhaps in extreme scenarios which weren't planned for  
which is the point of a rescue system  
otherwise undue buracracy increasing regulation on public land  
  
NPS is using skewed data   
and international catastrophe                   
to push a police state agenda  
  
this seems like an attempt to control and gather data  
specifically isolates a specific user group   
adds additional cost and complication which primarily impacts low income and minority users  
who knows what regulations climbers or others who are respectfully exploring the outdoors could eventually face  
  
next up: wear a satellite beacon registered with NPS, nasa and SPACEX    
must be worn at all times on public land or face fines and or imprisonment  
it's only $1700 for the tracker and the required service is $129.99 a month forever!  
  
based on nothing but intuition it seems likely that influential people in  
NPS, YOSAR and popular Yosemite climbing access groups are seeing benifits from this beyond the impact to everyday climbers  
   
at best it's a lazy way to get other people do do their work for them,    
while charging us for the privlidge   
  
more negative use cases involve data collection  
used for marketing, advertising, funding  
even potentially selling future permits for gatekeeping amounts of money  
(a permit costs 15,000 euro to climb popular routes on Mont Blanc in 2022,   
this is not resolving their rescue problem caused by undereducated, overconfident people)  
  
a likely outcome for this permit system is increasing popularity of big in-a-day climbs  
this style of climbing is incredibly risky, even when undertaken by pro-level climbers  
a large increase in popularity of speed climbing has potentially huge negative implications  
huge future potential for speed climbing to become popular with under or mis-educated masses   
this could cause a much larger strain on rescue resources than big wall climbing ever has
