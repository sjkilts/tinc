todo: |
  - [ ] check in with industrial designer on e-ink license plate
  - [ ] outline SMART grant requirements for both projects
  - [ ] game outline, storyline, concept drawings
  - [ ] see if writer friend is interested in game development
  - [ ] research micro-drone parts for tech deck
  - [ ] drone sim dev software
  - [ ] define and code movement based on gravity sports
  - [ ] consider traditional loads (i.e. dogsled, kayak, skid)
  - [ ] ion drive research
  - [ ] sound based power research
  - [ ] build a tech deck drone
  - [ ] build an ion tech deck
  - [ ] power it with sound
  - [ ] make it big
  - [ ] fly your cadillac to your floating rainforest moss island
  - [ ] meet bear, lynx, macaw, falcon and mouse friends
  - [ ] chill and work on cool stuff in the sky

*2022-10-20*  
  
- irl we really want the ion drive to work in atmosphere, and we need battery stuff to change dramatically  
- the sound-based battery system could work very well if we can get it out of the ocean / scale  
- am not a physicist so actually working on that myself is not really ideal?  
- will, if necessary. go to school?  would be better to have money to throw at physicists  
- something like the SMART grant would help  
- two ideas  
- 1 not that useful maybe but e-ink license plate. only legal in three states, but new. should be an easy sell  
- 2 floating load delivery platform proof of concept  
- - basically just a flat drone to push boxes around on  
- - could be self-guided eventually, main goal is have it respond to touch input  
- - so push on a side, it goes that direction  
- - compensates automatically to not tip when you push, etc.  
- - trying to build a scale model proof of concept, to move a scale load in the way a forklift typically does  
- - this inital product would then be roughly a forklift the size of a pallet, hopefully charged long enough to unload a truck  
- - remote user input to raise a load up into storage safely as an individual  
- - powered battery base that responds to the same usable touch input so the platform can charge in use unless flying  
- * e-ink license plate could probably be kickstarted with a render  
- - - this is a great side project that could mean big money  
- - - see if people are excited.  if an industrial designer chose to invest a little time this could happen quick  
- * side scroller game could be a fun way to build interest and make some side money  
- - start with jank battery powered drone hoverboard  
- - work up to ion drive, infinite power  
- - add in other cool things like the flying car, bike, home etc.  
- - like alto meets hill climb  
- - minimal ads, like alto  
- - store with merch etc  
- - early release a hoverboard through the game one day ;)  
- * something something floating carbon fiber cadillac luxury camper home  
- - like, its a whole new world baby  
- have enough knowledge to build some version of the drone thing, have an industrial designer to help with packaging  
- could probably get both of those ideas done without too much third party input?  
- we need third party input for the cool stuff.    
- if we can fund a feasibility report from MIT guys about the ion drive and sound based battery  
- that would be cool and tell us enough to either get big funding or sit on the idea  
-  
- blah blah future this could be a floating platform that cleans the air and is powered by sound what do you want  
- yes, flying surfboard  
- yes, flying car  
- your jetsons house is still kinda dumb  
- yes, floating moss hut
