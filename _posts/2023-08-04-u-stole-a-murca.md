it is important to protect certain things.

it is an abomination of space to parcel out land amongst people.  it defiles the land to redirect the rivers, or halt their flow.  it defiles the land to demonize and illigitimize that which is of the land. 

we all belong to the land. 
the land does not belong to us.

respect to something greater is an action.  it is not something you can claim or pretend.

the mask only covers your face.  did you think we could not see the rest of your body?
